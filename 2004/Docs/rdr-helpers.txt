Instruct runners (Rob):
1.  We will try our best, but everyone should count their own laps!
3.  Look on top of the steeple to see the results of the second
    die roll!
4.  Please be careful as you start the race not to trip fellow
    runners.
5.  We will roll the first die, then you will hear "Runners set".
    The race starts when you hear the horn.  The second die will be
    rolled as the leader is finishing the first set of laps.
6.  (In best Paul Winfield voice) "And now, the man who needs
    no introduction, our guest Randomness Provider for the Second
    Annual SCS Random Distance Run.  He's a Beacon of
    Randomness in an otherwise ordered world....
    Steeeveennnnn  Rudich!!"

Registration Procedure
----------------------

Use 5 people at a table -
2 people are taking registrations (preregs and new regs) giving pins and cards
1 person is pulling shirts for each person after they're checked in (preregs
    shirts are separate and labelled)
1 person is entering new registrations into the spreadsheet
1 person is taking forms to the person with the laptop and helping out
    where needed in this operation

One person takes pictures of the runners and the scene during warmups

Adam and Rob left to help out and oversee things and meet and prep Steven

Other volunteers will probably be running around doing last minute little things

--------------
Race Procedure
--------------

1 Steven rolls the dice.

3+ people split duty between lap counting and being in the finishing
    chute.  In the chute, one person is forcing people into the chute
    and another is forcing them to move through the chute.  The last
    person is handing them tongue depressors (with their finishing place
    on them) at the end of the chute.
    The two people at the front of the chute will hold the finishing
    tape for the first male and female runners.

2 people will deal with the timing.

1 person will be the starter/anouncer.

1-2 people will be at a table waiting to record peoples places into a
    spreadsheet as people bring over their tongue depressors.  A long
    line may form here, but we just need to make sure everyone brings
    over the tongue depressor before they leave.  Hopefully the laptop
    will last this long - if not, we need to have paper to record name
    and place so that we can put it in somewhere where there's an outlet.
