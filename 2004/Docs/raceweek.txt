Instruct runners:
1.  We will try our best, but everyone should count their own laps!
2.  Pacers will help keep track of how many laps are left - if unsure:
    finish when they finish.
2.  Look on top of the steeple to see the results of the second
    die roll!
3.  Please be careful as you start the race not to trip fellow
    runners.
4.  We will roll the first die, then you will hear "Runners set".
    The race starts when you hear the horn.  The second die will be
    rolled as the leader is finishing the first set of laps.
5.  (In best Paul Winfield voice) "And now, the man who needs

Registration Procedure
----------------------

Use 5 people at a table -
2 people are taking registrations (preregs and new regs) giving pins and cards
1 person is pulling shirts for each person after they're checked in (preregs
    shirts are separate and labelled)
1 person is entering new registrations into the spreadsheet
1 person is taking forms to the person with the laptop and helping out
    where needed in this operation

One person takes pictures of the warmups

Adam and Rob left to help out and oversee things

--------------
Race Procedure
--------------

Use all 9 people:
1 person (Steven) rolls the dice.
3 people split duty between lap counting and being in the finishing
    chute.  In the chute, one person is forcing people into the chute
    and another is forcing them to move through the chute.  The last
    person is handing them tongue depressors at the end of the chute.
    The two people at the front of the chute will hold the finishing
    tape at the appropriate times.
2 people will deal with the timing.

1 person will be the starter/anouncer.

1 person will be ready to record the tongue depressors into the spreadsheet.

-------------------
Post Race Procedure
-------------------

Everyone will keep people organized about lining up to return the
   tongue depressors while one person actually enters the places into
   the spreadsheet.

Then we figure out the prize winners and announce them at the TG.
