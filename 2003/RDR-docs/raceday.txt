Instruct runners:

2.  Look on top of the steeple to see the results of the second
    die roll!
3.  Please be careful as you start the race not to trip fellow
    runners.
4.  We will roll the first die, then you will hear "Runners set".
    The race starts when you hear the gun.  The second die will be
        rolled as the leader is finishing the first set of laps.
5.  (In best Paul Winfield voice) "And now, the man who needs
    no introduction, our guest Randomness Provider for the First

    MAAAAAAANUELLLLLLLL  BLUM!!"

----------------------
Registration Procedure
----------------------

Use 4 people at a table -
1 person is giving pins and cards to the pre-registrants
1 person is pulling shirts for each person after they're checked in
1 person is taking forms from new registrants and giving them index
    cards with their race number and name
1 person is entering new registrations into the spreadsheet

--------------
Race Procedure
--------------

Use all 7 people:
1 person (Manuel) rolls the dice and holds one end of the finishing
    tape.
2 people split duty between lap counting and being in the finishing
    chute.  In the chute, one person is guiding people from the
    finish into the chute and the other is taking tags and putting
    them on the stick.  The person guiding people should also hold
    one end of the finishing tape.
4 people will deal with the finishing orders.
    I think we should use the check system.  I'll print out a list
    of times between 2min and 40min and we can just put a number
    next to each corresponding to how many people finish at that time.
    Every once in a while (when there's a break) write down a race
    number to maintain consistency.  One people should be running the
    watch getting splits and calling out times so that the two
    people with the checklist can check off the times.  The other
    person should just keep a running watch in case the first one
    gets messed up!  That person will also serve as the photographer.
One of the people will also serve as the starter.

-------------------
Post Race Procedure
-------------------

2 people will fill in the times and then determine the winner for
each prize.  They should also print a couple of copies of the whole
list so that

After everything's finished we hold a little awards ceremony at the
TG (we can use the stairs as a stage and just use our voices to
announce)

---------------------------
For future ref - what else?
---------------------------

Talk to Dario about reserving track in January

Advertise 5-6 weeks in advance
(spam department and then put posters up) (poster
wean elevators, lounge, nsh elevators, hh elevators, stats dept)
(use pdf on the website, some people have trouble with ps) (give
office number and mailbox for dropping off registrations)

Order dice before the pre-registration ends
(ours were 8" sides for the big ones and 5" sides for the others)

Have a pre registration deadline a week before the t-shirt
order is due (send out an email reminding people before the
preregistration deadline) (email advisors of pre-registrants to
encourage them to enter)
