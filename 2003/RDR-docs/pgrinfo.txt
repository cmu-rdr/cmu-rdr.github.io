Notes:
1.  Costs were higher this year with $135 for plaques for Jim Tomayko
& Ellen Saxon for their years of service running the PGR.
2.  We had a lot of volunteers, about 14 race day and 8 who helped
with advertising, collecting forms, etc. Each volunteer got a t-shirt.
3.  We should be able to cover the $75 loss from next year's income.
In the meantime, I'll cover the loss.

Organizational Notes:

1.  We had an excess of race-day volunteers (most of the MSE students)
but it's better to have too much than too little as we've seen in the
past. An ideal number is about 8 on race day - 2 at the ¾ mile mark, 2 at
the turn around, 3-4 to help with the start & finish.
2.  Need more water for the start and finish.
3.  Allowing race entries right up to the start complicates the
t-shirt order and adds some delays to the start. May be best to have 2
deadlines, with the entries coming in after Wed at noon all going into a
post race shirt order. This would perhaps split the shirt order into 2
decent sized allotments and allow us to get the quantity discount on both
orders. In a small order, the shirts end up costing more than the $8 entry
fee. Need a more streamlined procedure for handling entries at the start.
It's worth it to have entries right up to the start - we added 15 more
runners to the race at the start and another 15 that came in after the
normal Wed deadline.
4.  Have the runners' tags with names and teams prepared before race
day to save time at the start.
5.  Need to have a more efficient way to handle the finish line. With
a large number of runners we had this year, we had many clusters of
runners finishing simultaneously, making matching runners to their times
more problematic.
6.  Need to have markings on the course just in case we don't get
volunteers to help direct the runners.
7.  Computing the results at the end can be time consuming with a
large group of runners. Consider first just getting the top finishers and
team standings prepared and present the awards before all results are
tabulated. Otherwise the TG may be over before we get to announce the
results and give out awards.
8.  Had the IC director post my msg announcing the race and results to
ensure more people would read it.
9.  Coordinate with IC director and grad assistant (Michael Lewicki &
Yan Karklin for 2002) on scheduling of the race on the IC calendar. Race
is sponsored by SCS and so arranged for Decfive (Andrew Faulring was
treasurer in 2002) to be the target of check payments for entry forms and
to house race accounting records and receipts.
10. Try to enlist some of the same people to help next year:
            Jim Tomayko & Ellen Saxon - organizational advice and suggestions
            Duane Willliams - did a lot: PGR website, race postings, directed start and
                    finish line, helped tabulate results
            Catherine Copetas - created a nice color poster, knows where to locate posters
                    and entry forms
            Sharon Burks - handled collection of entry forms
            Kathy McNiff & Jennifer Lucas - stocked entry forms at CS main office
            Angela Brookins - handled forms for undergrads on the 5th floor Wean
            Vandana Verma - advice on shirt colors
            MSE Students - provided race day help on the course
